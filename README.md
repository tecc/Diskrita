# Diskrita 

Diskrita simply interfaces with the Discord Game SDK to set your activity to be Krita.

## Supported platforms

As far as I'm aware, Diskrita supports all major platforms running on x86-64 hardware. This includes Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.

## Licence

Diskrita is licensed under the [MIT licence](./LICENCE.txt).

Under the hood it's powered by [LennyPhoenix's py-discord-sdk library](https://github.com/LennyPhoenix/py-discord-sdk). All of the files belonging to PDK are located in [diskrita/dsdk](./diskrita/dsdk), and are licenced under the MIT licence as well.
